These are not in any particular order, but stuff near the bottom is probably far off...
------
* Make sure that things in common_objs aren't calling termbox or tuilib bits
* Finish TextArea implementation
* Finish InputBox implementation
* Complete ft8decoder using ft8lib for ft4 and ft8
* Get messages displaying in ft8goblin from test samples sent to ft8decoder processes
* Get sigcapd pulling from usrp and slicing appropriately ot feed ft8decoder processes
* Work on database logging
* Add TX support, using usrp or hamlib supported rigs
* Document things
* instead of timeout in seconds, timeout after X unacknowledged TXes
* Work on making things smart enough to deal with being installed on the host
