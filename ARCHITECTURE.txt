Here's a rough draft of how things work

	callsign-lookupd
		Looks up call signs via QRZ XML API and local FCC ULS database.
		Caches the results of lookups for fast recall, using sqlite3.

	ft8goblin (Main process)
		Provides a user interface for this mess.

		Supervises subprocess below

	decoderd-ft8
		Decodes FT4 and FT8 messages on various bands
		Listens for frames from sigcapd

	encoderd-ft8
		Encodes FT4 and FT8 messages for transmission
		Sends frames via alsa/pulse to a rig controlled by hamlib

	sigcapd
		Controls and captures samples from a radio and provides samples
		to decoderd-*
