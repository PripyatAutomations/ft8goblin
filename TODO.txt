These are not in any particular order, but stuff near the bottom is probably far off...
------
* Make sure that things in common_objs aren't calling termbox or tuilib bits
  - or just be make sure they're smart enough to check if termbox is active
    and if not use log_send() ;)
* Finish TextArea implementation
* Add history to InputBox widget's line editing
* Finish KeyBindings mess, so we can clean up the tu-input code
* Implement Keymap with help, callback, etc.
  - This should allow clicking them with the mouse
* Rework the key binding help to be derived from the active keymap, so it
  updates keys available as you move around the program
* Waterfall window
* Work on database logging
* Complete ft8decoder using ft8lib for ft4 and ft8
* Get messages displaying in ft8goblin from test samples sent to ft8decoder processes
* Finish QRZ XML api implementation
* Finish FCC ULS database stuff
* Get sigcapd pulling from usrp and slicing appropriately to feed decoderd-* processes
* Add TX support, using usrp or hamlib supported rigs and alsa/pulseaudio
  XXX: Find a library that will make this easier
* Document things
* instead of timeout in seconds, timeout after X unacknowledged TXes
* Work on making things smart enough to deal with being installed on the host
