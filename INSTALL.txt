PREREQS
-------
You will need the following packages installed on the host:
	libev-dev libyajl-dev gnuradio libuhd librtlsdr-dev libxml2-dev
	libsqlite3-mod-spatialite librasterlite2-dev libspatialite-dev
	spatialite-bin libmxml-dev

If you want to use the perl scripts in scripts, you'll probably want these too:
	libdbi-perl libxml-simple-perl libdbd-sqlite3-perl libdbd-pg-perl
	libdbd-mysql-perl libterm-readline-perl-perl liblog-log4perl-perl
	libtext-csv-perl

If you'd like to use postgresql:
	libpq-dev postgresql-doc postgresql-postgis postgresql-postgis-scripts
	postgresql-pgrouting postgresql-pgrouting-scripts postgis

These are the devuan/debian names for them, your distro may vary.
Some of these probably aren't required.. I'll clean the lists up when I
release this mess...

BUILDING
--------
Edit config.mk to reflect any desired build-time optional configuration

There's no need to manually build things unless intending to do an
(UNSUPPORTED AT THIS TIME!) host installation.

RUNNING
-------
./startup

This script handles a handle of startup tasks for you:
	* set up logging and debug options
	* git pull for latest version, only if it's been over an hour
          we can ping github.com
	* setup library paths for ./lib/
	* cleaning and recompiling (this should take under a minute even on
	  older machines
	* Deleting old log files in log/
	* Cleaning up run/
	* launching ./bin/ft8goblin, optionally (if -g passed) under GDB debugger

EXTERNAL DATA
-------------
Either you'll need a QRZ.com subscription with XML access or every now and
then to download the FCC database (which will only have US data).

Right now the fcc-uls stuff is incomplete and unusable.

Work is in progress to implement importing GNIS global place names database.
