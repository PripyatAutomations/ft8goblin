To configure things, edit config.json


Here you'll setup your bands and their respective ports to match
what you have in the GNU Radio Compation (GRC) flowgraph.

These *MUST* match or things will be stupid

You probably want to make sure supervise-ft8decoder and supervise-ft8capture
are set to true, otherwise, you'll need to manually make sure they're
running.

ft8decoder takes one argument, the name of the band it should match from
config.json - this will configure it's UDP port, etc.
