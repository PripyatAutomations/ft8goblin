PREREQS
-------
You will need the following packages installed on the host:

	libev-dev libyajl-dev gnuradio libuhd librtlsdr-dev
	libsqlite3-mod-spatialite librasterlite2-dev libspatialite-dev spatialite-bin 

These are the devuan/debian names for them, your distro may vary.

BUILDING
--------

Try 'make clean world' to build.

You'll need sudo access to install termbox2, if it's not already installed.

EXTERNAL DATA
-------------
Either you'll need a QRZ.com subscription with XML access or every now and
then to download the FCC database (which will only have US data).

Right now the fcc-uls stuff is incomplete and unusable.

Work is in progress to implement importing GNIS global place names database.
